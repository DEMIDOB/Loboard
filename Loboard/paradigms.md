## Loboard principles
We are a relatively young and useless project that should anyway have its core principles defined. Here they are: 

1. Devices are ~~non~~-binary, thus, two devices have either 0 or only 1 connection.
2. We are obedient, thus, your mistakes are your mistakes. We do what you tell us to do.
3. These rules are comprehensive. If you have any questions,\
{\
&nbsp;goto are;\
}

Sincerely,\
Loboard Pancake Team
